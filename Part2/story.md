## Day 1

Hildegard could be a good boxer!  

6 Days to Nuln, offered to train and could enter a tournament when we get there.  

About lunchtime Hannah makes her way over to Randall.  She wanted advice on what to do with her life now she was in this position.  Told her to make sure she had income, possibly to do with boats as her father  was a shipbuilder.

Wanda rescues a tortoiseshell kitten from a floating branch and calls it "River"

Test test test

Stay in a little village name Reikschpittle

## Day 2

Woken by a coughing fit, kitchen is on fire!  Breakfast is only oat cakes and cheese

Ulrika drags me into helping with the boat and teaches me the basic

Hannah offers to share a bottle of wine with Wander in the afternoon  

Another boat comes into view in the evening. It's Hildegard's uncle, Josef Quartjin's boat. The Berebeli.

Evening of entertainment for all.  Wanda renames the kitten to Ser Pouncealot

## Day 3

We come to the town of Grisenwald  

Liebefreude invites me into his antique shop. Set of tableware plate.

## Day 4

We saw a pirate on the gallows tree

## Day 5

Hannah drinks with Wanda all night.

## Day 6

Wanda and Hannah are both dazed all day.

Boat almost sinks us, and we limp into Nuln.

A young man steps out of the shadows, wearing his first moustache and a cap, offering a service.

The blind pig inn.  Place is heaving, full of dancing girls, mercs, nobles, many people from foreign lands. Mural of a woman with tatoos of a white fish with teeth

Find a board

Anders Blowheart guides us to the Slaughtered Lamb

After an uncomfortable night, we are led around a tour of the city, starting with a waffle house

Eventually after the tour, we arrive at an alchemists shop belonging to Rudolf

Door open at the back, shop had been turned over and there is a painting of a white fish with large teeth.
