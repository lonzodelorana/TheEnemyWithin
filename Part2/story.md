Eventually after the tour, we arrive at an apothecary shop belonging to Rudolf, 22 Brockstraza

Door open at the back, shop had been turned over and there is a painting of a white fish with large teeth.

Just background magic

Specific things have been searched for - not generally robbed, the person who did this knew what they wanted.  

Clue - 5 Very specific herbs have been taken

Took her to the slaughtered lamb and had a meal

We go around talking to locals about Heinrick

He is out tonight

Member of the Satchenheimer gang  
Based in an area of the city called the asylum, a set of abandoned basements and bits of sewer, out just past the great bridge.

After a difficult fight Hildegard defeats Heinrick and much money is made!  

We get her patched up and go to bed
